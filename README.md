### OpenAPI Renderer Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin generates a Swagger-UI interface and embeds it as an iframe in the current view of a note.

### Important notes:
- Plugin searches for a YAML or JSON file in the current folder of the opened note. OpenAPI specification should be in YAML / JSON format in the same folder. Make sure that the name of the specification file corresponds to the plugin setting
- By default, generates HTML file named openapi-spec.html in the folder with YAML file.
- Default OpenAPI specification filename is "openapi-spec.yaml" in the same folder.
- Needs internet access to download Swagger UI and js-yaml from CDNs.
- There are two ways to update the Swagger UI preview:
  - Manual (by default): after changing the HTML file, call the Refresh Swagger UI command (Ctrl + L by default)
  - Automatic: enable the 'Auto Update' option in the plugin settings. When you update 
    specification from an external application and save a file with it, the plugin tracks 
    saves the file and generates a new HTML file and also updates the iframe.

### Known issues
- When using the "VSCode Editor" plugin to edit YAMl/JSON specification files there may be 
  problems with automatic updates. Use manual update or edit 
  specification in an external tool (for example, notepad)


### Installation

### Usage
- Open note in same directory as OpenAPI YAML/JSON file.
