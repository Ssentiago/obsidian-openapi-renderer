all file extension` option in Settings -> Files and Links.

### OpenAPI Version view

This view allows you to manage different versions of your OpenAPI specifications. You can create new
versions, view existing ones, restore previous versions, and delete unnecessary ones, ensuring that
your API documentation remains up-to-date and version-controlled. Additionally, you can compare
versions side-by-side to see the differences between them
How to use it: Open the view from the sidebar or directly from the OpenAPI View to start managing
your spec versions.

**Available actions**:

- Export all versions as a Zip: Quickly export all saved versions of your specification as a single
  Zip file

### OpenAPI Entry view

This view provides an overview of all your tracked OpenAPI specifications from the vault in one
interface. For each specification, you can see the total version count and the date of the last
update, making it easy to keep track of your API documentation.

**From this view, you can:**

- **Open spec in OpenAPI View:** Directly view and edit your specification.
- **Open spec in Version View:** Manage versions, compare changes, and restore previous versions.
- **Export spec as a Zip file:** Save the current specification and all its versions as a Zip file
  for backup or sharing.
- **Restore last version:** Replace the current content in the vault with the latest saved version (
  creates the file if it does not exist).
- **Remove version from tracking:** Stop tracking the file versions, but the file itself remains in
  the vault.

**How to use it:** Open the Entry View from the ribbon menu on the left by pressing
the `Open OpenAPI Entry View` button, or press `Ctrl + P` to open the command palette and search
for `OpenAPI Entry`.

**How it looks:**
