# OpenAPI Renderer Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin generates a Swagger-UI interface and embeds it as an iframe in the current view of an Obsidian note.

## Features

- Renders OpenAPI specifications as interactive Swagger UI
- Supports both YAML and JSON formats
- Embedded lightweight Express server for local file serving
- Flexible rendering options: inline or in a modal window
- Customizable UI settings
- Automatic and manual update options

## Installation

1. Copy plugin files to `.obsidian/plugins/openapi-renderer/` in your Obsidian vault.
2. Enable the plugin in Obsidian settings (Settings â†’ Community plugins).

## Usage

1. Open a note in the same directory as your OpenAPI YAML/JSON file.
2. Use one of the following methods to render the Swagger UI:
   - Use the command palette to choose between inline or modal rendering or set key for it
3. The Swagger UI should appear in your note or a modal window.

## Configuration

Customize the plugin in the settings:

### Server Settings

## Key Features

## Known Issues

## Important Notes

- The plugin searches for YAML or JSON files in the current folder of the opened note.
- Ensure that the specification filename matches your plugin settings.
- Internet access is required for now to download Swagger UI and js-yaml from CDNs.
